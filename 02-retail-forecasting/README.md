# Retail Sales Forecasting (Time Series Project)

This project analyzes monthly retail sales data and builds a forecasting model to predict future sales trends.

## What I Did
1. Loaded raw retail sales data.
2. Cleaned and processed the data.
3. Created a 12-month rolling average to smooth trends.
4. Visualized the historical sales trend.
5. Used Facebook Prophet to forecast the next 24 months.
6. Saved both the processed data and charts for reporting.

## Key Visuals
- Trend Chart: `visuals/retail_sales_trend.png`
- Forecast Chart: `visuals/retail_sales_forecast.png`

## Data Files
- Raw Data: `data/raw/retail_sales.csv`
- Processed Data: `data/processed/retail_sales_processed.csv`

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Prophet (for forecasting)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Next Improvements
- Build a dashboard version in Power BI
- Try a different model (ARIMA / Seasonal Decomposition)
